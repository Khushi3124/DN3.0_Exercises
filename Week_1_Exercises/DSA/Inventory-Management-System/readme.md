# Understand the Problem

##	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories
- Efficient Data Storage: Proper data structures ensure that inventory data is stored in a way that minimizes memory usage and supports quick access.
- Fast Retrieval and Updates: Algorithms optimized for searching, inserting, and updating ensure that operations can be performed quickly, which is crucial for managing large inventories.
- Scalability: Data structures that can handle growing amounts of data without significant performance degradation are essential.
- Data Integrity and Consistency: Using appropriate data structures ensures that inventory data remains consistent and accurate, even with concurrent access and modifications.

##  Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem
Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem are:
- ArrayList: Provides dynamic array capabilities, allowing for efficient random access and easy resizing.
- HashMap: Offers constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and look-up operations, making it ideal for inventory management.
- TreeMap: Maintains sorted order of keys and allows for efficient range queries and ordered operations.

# Analysis

##  Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure
Average Time Complexity of Each Operation 
1. Add Product: O(1) - Insertion in a HashMap is generally constant time.
2. Update Product: O(1) - Updating a value in a HashMap is also constant time.
3. Delete Product: O(1) - Removing an entry from a HashMap is constant time.

In Worst case, where multiple keys hash to the same bucket, operations can degrade to O(n) due to collisions.

##	Discuss how you can optimize these operations
1. Batch Processing: For bulk updates or inserts, consider batch processing to reduce the overhead of multiple individual operations.
2. Concurrency: Use concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap if the inventory management system needs to handle simultaneous read/write operations by multiple threads.
3. Indexing: If search operations on non-key attributes (e.g., productName) become frequent, consider adding indexing mechanisms or secondary data structures to support faster lookups.
