# Understand Linked Lists

## Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List)?

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
Instead, each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.   

Types of Linked Lists:
1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.


# Analysis

## Analyze the time complexity of each operation?

  Add: O(n)
  Search: O(n)
  Traverse: O(n)
  Delete: O(n)

## Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data?
Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays are:
1. Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
2. Efficient insertions and deletions: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is generally faster than in an array, especially in the middle of the list.
3. Flexibility: Linked lists can be used to implement various data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
